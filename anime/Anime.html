                    <p>two high school geniuses, Shirogane and Kaguya, can't admit they're in love, so each tries to win
                        a confession of affection from the other. This results in increasingly ridiculous mind games in
                        which they end up outsmarting themselves.</p>

                        In the year 2019 AD, a mysterious flash suddenly petrifies nearly all human life. 3,700 years
                        pass with the human race frozen in stone, until in April 5738, a 15-year-old prodigy named
                        Senku Ishigami is suddenly revived to find himself in a world where all traces of human
                        civilization have been eroded by time. Senku sets up a basecamp and begins to study the
                        petrified humans in order to determine the cause of the event, as well as a cure.</p>
